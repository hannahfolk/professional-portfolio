          Hello there! :)<br /><br />
          <img src="./assets/images/hannah.png" alt="headshot" />
          ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hannah Folk. I'm a full stack web developer based in Los
          Angeles, CA. My favorite technologies to code in are React, MySQL, and
          Javascript. Currently I work for Hearful Hub as a Junior Backend
          Engineer and Trilogy Education as a Senior Tutor in Full Stack Web
          Development.<br /><br />
          When I was in high school, I took AP Computer Science and completely
          failed it. I was so discouraged from doing anything computer science
          related, and so I turned to Math, Econ, and Theatre at UC San Diego.
          But I did still have to take one computer science course for a GE,
          Introduction to Programming: Java. Something must have clicked back in
          high school because that class was a breeze. From there, I wanted to
          be a CS minor, but I could not fit it into my schedule in four years.
          I tried self-studying throughout the years as well, but I never had
          the time or the motivation to sit down and commit.
          <br /><br />
          So when I graduated and moved to Los Angeles, I decided to do the UCLA
          Extension Coding Bootcamp, and it was the best decision I've ever made
          in my life.<br /><br />
          When I'm not coding (or quarantined), I train at a parkour gym,
          practice Kung Fu, and sing my heart out to a myriad of Disney songs.
